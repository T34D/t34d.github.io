<b>Hi! I'm <i>Thilanka</i></b>, I'm a Sommelier and a geek and that's probably why i'm making some weird shit right now <a href="http://alsaceaquai.github.io/god.html">(like this page)</a>.
<!-- I don't usually make webpages but here I am, writing this on a new one I develop in the last couple of days because I didn't like anything I found. -->
<br>
<b><!--What do I do?--></b>
<!--I manage sites and servers for a bunch of people and write weird stuff, you can check my <a href="https://github.com/EduFdezSoy" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, I usually upload all I can.-->
<br>
<!--<b>And on my free time?</b>--
<!--80% reading manga
5% playing games
5% watching anime-->
<!-- <b>and the last 10%?</b> SCIENCE.-->
<!--Side projects, 3D, microcontrollers, learning new technologies or languages or even woodwork. -->
<br>
I think that's all I have to say, so <b>follow me, won't you?</b>
